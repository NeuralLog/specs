# NeuralLog Backup and Recovery Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the backup and recovery strategy for NeuralLog, ensuring data durability, business continuity, and disaster recovery capabilities.

## Backup Strategy

### Data Categories

NeuralLog data is categorized based on criticality and backup requirements:

1. **Critical Data**:
   - User accounts and authentication data
   - Tenant configuration
   - Rules and actions
   - Billing information

2. **Operational Data**:
   - Recent logs (last 7 days)
   - Active sessions
   - System configuration

3. **Historical Data**:
   - Older logs
   - Analytics data
   - Audit trails

### Backup Types

1. **Full Backups**:
   - Complete backup of all data
   - Performed weekly
   - Retained for 3 months

2. **Incremental Backups**:
   - Changes since last backup
   - Performed daily
   - Retained for 1 month

3. **Continuous Backups**:
   - Real-time replication
   - For critical data only
   - Point-in-time recovery

### Backup Schedule

| Data Category | Backup Type | Frequency | Retention |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Critical | Full | Weekly | 3 months |
| Critical | Incremental | Daily | 1 month |
| Critical | Continuous | Real-time | 7 days |
| Operational | Full | Weekly | 1 month |
| Operational | Incremental | Daily | 7 days |
| Historical | Full | Monthly | 1 year |

## Backup Implementation

### Database Backups

PostgreSQL backup configuration:

```yaml
# PostgreSQL backup job
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: postgres-backup
  namespace: neurallog-data
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: postgres-backup
            image: postgres:14
            command:
            - /bin/bash
            - -c
            - |
              pg_dump -h postgresql -U postgres -d neurallog -F c -f /backups/neurallog-$(date +%Y%m%d).dump
              find /backups -name "neurallog-*.dump" -mtime +30 -delete
            env:
            - name: PGPASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: postgresql-credentials
                  key: password
            volumeMounts:
            - name: backup-volume
              mountPath: /backups
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          volumes:
          - name: backup-volume
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: postgres-backup-pvc
```

### Elasticsearch Backups

Elasticsearch snapshot configuration:

```json
// Register snapshot repository
PUT /_snapshot/neurallog_backup
{
  "type": "s3",
  "settings": {
    "bucket": "neurallog-backups",
    "region": "us-west-2",
    "role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/elasticsearch-backup"
  }
}

// Create snapshot policy
PUT /_slm/policy/daily-snapshots
{
  "schedule": "0 2 * * *",
  "name": "neurallog-snapshot-{now/d}",
  "repository": "neurallog_backup",
  "config": {
    "indices": ["neurallog-*"],
    "ignore_unavailable": true,
    "include_global_state": false
  },
  "retention": {
    "expire_after": "30d",
    "min_count": 5,
    "max_count": 50
  }
}
```

### File Storage Backups

S3 bucket replication configuration:

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Priority": 1,
      "DeleteMarkerReplication": { "Status": "Disabled" },
      "Filter": {
        "Prefix": "logs/"
      },
      "Destination": {
        "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::neurallog-backup-bucket",
        "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA",
        "ReplicationTime": {
          "Status": "Enabled",
          "Time": {
            "Minutes": 15
          }
        },
        "Metrics": {
          "Status": "Enabled",
          "EventThreshold": {
            "Minutes": 15
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Objectives

1. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**:
   - Critical data: 5 minutes
   - Operational data: 24 hours
   - Historical data: 7 days

2. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**:
   - Critical services: 1 hour
   - Non-critical services: 4 hours
   - Complete system: 8 hours

### Recovery Scenarios

1. **Single Service Failure**:
   - Automatic failover to replicas
   - No manual intervention required
   - No data loss

2. **Zone Failure**:
   - Automatic failover to other zones
   - No manual intervention required
   - Minimal data loss (seconds)

3. **Region Failure**:
   - Manual failover to backup region
   - Requires operator intervention
   - Some data loss (minutes to hours)

4. **Complete System Failure**:
   - Full system restore from backups
   - Requires operator intervention
   - Data loss up to last backup

### Recovery Procedures

#### Database Recovery

PostgreSQL recovery procedure:

```bash
# Restore PostgreSQL database
pg_restore -h postgresql -U postgres -d neurallog -c /backups/neurallog-20230408.dump
```

#### Elasticsearch Recovery

Elasticsearch recovery procedure:

```json
// Restore Elasticsearch snapshot
POST /_snapshot/neurallog_backup/neurallog-snapshot-2023.04.08/_restore
{
  "indices": ["neurallog-*"],
  "ignore_unavailable": true,
  "include_global_state": false,
  "rename_pattern": "neurallog-(.+)",
  "rename_replacement": "restored-neurallog-$1"
}
```

#### Complete System Recovery

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - Deploy Kubernetes cluster
   - Set up networking and storage
   - Configure security

2. **Data Restoration**:
   - Restore databases from backups
   - Restore file storage
   - Verify data integrity

3. **Service Deployment**:
   - Deploy core services
   - Deploy tenant services
   - Configure external access

4. **Verification**:
   - Run health checks
   - Verify functionality
   - Test critical paths

## Backup Verification

### Automated Testing

1. **Backup Validation**:
   - Automated verification of backup integrity
   - Checksums and consistency checks
   - Performed after each backup

2. **Restore Testing**:
   - Automated restore to test environment
   - Functional testing of restored system
   - Performed weekly

### Disaster Recovery Drills

1. **Tabletop Exercises**:
   - Simulated disaster scenarios
   - Team response practice
   - Performed quarterly

2. **Full Recovery Drills**:
   - Complete system recovery in isolated environment
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performed semi-annually

## Multi-Region Strategy

### Active-Passive Configuration

1. **Primary Region**:
   - Handles all production traffic
   - Full deployment of all services
   - Continuous backups to secondary region

2. **Secondary Region**:
   - Standby deployment
   - Minimal running services
   - Regular data synchronization

3. **Failover Process**:
   - DNS failover to secondary region
   - Scale up secondary region services
   - Verify data consistency

### Active-Active Configuration (Optional)

1. **Multiple Active Regions**:
   - All regions handle production traffic
   - Geographic routing of requests
   - Cross-region data replication

2. **Data Consistency**:
   - Eventually consistent data model
   - Conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Metadata synchronization

3. **Failover Process**:
   - Automatic routing away from failed region
   - No manual intervention required
   - Minimal service disruption

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Automation**: Automate all backup and recovery processes
2. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed recovery procedures
3. **Testing**: Regularly test backup and recovery processes
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor backup success and failures
5. **Security**: Encrypt all backups at rest and in transit
6. **Access Control**: Restrict access to backup systems
7. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with data retention policies
