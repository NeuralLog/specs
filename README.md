## Overview

NeuralLog is an intelligent logging system with automated action capabilities. It captures log events from various sources, analyzes patterns in those logs, and triggers configurable actions when specific conditions are met.

The system is designed with multi-tenancy in mind, ensuring complete isolation between tenants while allowing organization-level separation within each tenant.
