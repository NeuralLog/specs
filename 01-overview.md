# NeuralLog: Zero-Knowledge Telemetry and Logging Service

## Overview

NeuralLog is a zero-knowledge telemetry and logging service designed for AI-powered applications. It provides powerful logging, search, and analysis capabilities while maintaining complete data privacy through end-to-end encryption and zero-knowledge cryptography.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Server Knowledge**: The server never possesses encryption keys or plaintext data
2. **End-to-End Encryption**: All data is encrypted client-side before transmission
3. **Searchable Encryption**: Enables searching encrypted logs without decryption
4. **Metadata-Level RBAC**: Access control implemented purely through metadata
5. **Tenant Isolation**: Complete cryptographic separation between tenants
6. **AI-Ready**: Designed for AI-powered analysis and insights

## System Components

### 1. Auth Service

- Manages authentication and authorization
- Implements zero-knowledge API key verification
- Stores only verification hashes, never actual keys
- Uses Redis for fast access to verification data
- Maintains strict tenant isolation

### 2. Logs Service

- Stores and indexes encrypted logs
- Handles search queries using searchable encryption tokens
- Performs analysis on encrypted data without decryption
- Scales horizontally for high throughput
- Maintains zero knowledge of log contents

### 3. Web Application

- Stateless Next.js application
- All cryptographic operations happen in the browser
- Provides intuitive UI for log management and analysis
- Implements client-side encryption and decryption
- Maintains zero server-side state

### 4. Client SDKs

- Libraries for various programming languages
- Handle client-side encryption and token generation
- Provide simple API for developers
- Implement batching and retry logic
- Maintain consistent behavior across languages

## Key Features

### Zero-Knowledge Logging

- All log content is encrypted client-side
- Server never sees plaintext log data
- Encryption keys never leave the client
- Even a complete server breach reveals no useful information

### Searchable Encryption

- Search logs without server decryption
- Tokens generated client-side using HMAC
- Server indexes tokens without knowing their meaning
- Multiple users in same tenant can search the same logs

### Metadata-Level RBAC

- Role-based access control without compromising zero knowledge
- Permissions enforced through metadata checks
- Immediate revocation through metadata updates
- Complete audit trail of all RBAC changes

### Deterministic Key Hierarchy

- All keys derived from a single master secret
- Hierarchical key structure with deterministic paths
- No need to store or distribute individual keys
- Supports password-based or m-of-n shared secrets

### AI-Powered Analysis

- Pattern detection on encrypted data
- Anomaly detection without decryption
- Zero-knowledge reports and insights
- Selective decryption for detailed investigation

## User Flows

### Developer Onboarding

1. Admin invites developer via email
2. Developer creates account with password
3. Developer generates API key in web interface
4. Developer adds API key to environment variables
5. Developer starts logging with SDK

### Log Access Control

1. Admin assigns roles to users via web interface
2. Roles determine which logs users can access
3. Access control is enforced through metadata checks
4. Revocation is immediate through metadata updates

### Secure Analysis

1. Users can search encrypted logs without server decryption
2. Analysis is performed on encrypted data using token patterns
3. Results are decrypted client-side
4. Zero-knowledge reports can be generated and shared

## Technical Specifications

### Cryptographic Algorithms

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Derivation**: HKDF with SHA-256
- **Searchable Encryption**: HMAC-SHA256
- **API Key Verification**: Argon2id

### Performance Targets

- **Log Ingestion**: 10,000+ logs per second per tenant
- **Search Latency**: < 500ms for most queries
- **SDK Overhead**: < 5ms per log entry
- **Storage Efficiency**: < 1.5x overhead vs. plaintext

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling for all components
- Tenant-specific Redis instances
- Sharding for high-volume tenants
- Multi-region deployment support

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Security First**: Security is the top priority in all design decisions
2. **Developer Experience**: Simple, intuitive API for developers
3. **Performance Focus**: Minimize overhead and latency
4. **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from day one
5. **Auditability**: Comprehensive audit trails for all operations
